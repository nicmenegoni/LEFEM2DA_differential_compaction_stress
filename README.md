# LEFEM2DA_differential_compaction_stress
Linear Elastic Finite Element Method 2-Dimension Analysis (LEFEM2DA) of  the stress tensor generated in a carbonate platform due to the differential compaction of the basinal unit.
These Finte Element Models want to analyze the possible stress field generated by the differential compaction of the basinal unit using the linear elastic theory.
The parameters of the basinal facies have been choosed in order to reproduce the amount of displacement of basinal top that is achieved by the porosity-depth change method (e.g. Sclater and Christie 1980) using MOVE suite and the same model geometry and carbonate platform density.
These model drastically simplify the carbonate platform and basinal unit consiedring them as homogeneous materials, because want to investigate how the differential compaction of basinal unit due to different geometry of carbonate platform influences the stress field of the carbonate platform and, consequently, how differential compaction-driven fractures can be oriented.
